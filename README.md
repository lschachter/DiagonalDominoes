# DiagonalDominoes
A two player, sequential move game using a weighted minimax algorithm. Built in Python using Zelle's Graphics (forgive me).

=============


This game uses a weighted minimax algorithm to make moves that either go towards beating the human player, or (if you are likely to lose no matter what) it takes into account the likelihood of human error based on the number of options the human has that could make him/her lose. 

RUN IN Python 3, any version .1-current

To run, open main.py and run program.
