# DiagonalDominoes
A two-player, sequential move game played by a human and a computer. Built in Python using Zelle's Graphics (forgive me).

=============


The computer player's software uses a weighted minimax algorithm to make moves that either go towards beating the human player, or (if it is likely to lose no matter what) it takes into account the likelihood of human error based on the number of options the human has that could lead him/her to lose. 

RUN IN Python 3, any version .1-current

To run, open main.py and run program.
